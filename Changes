Revision history for Perl extension Dist-Zilla-LocaleTextDomain

0.82  2012-12-03T19:06:03Z
     - Fixed broken call to `log_fatal` in the `msg-init` command that caused
       the actual error to be lost in favor of a bad method call error. Thanks
       Joenio Costa for the patch.
     - Added a note on how to get Locale::TextDomain to return character
       strings instead of byte strings.
     - Now refuse to build if `gettext --version` does not work at build time.

0.81  2012-10-02T16:25:43Z
      - Removed tests for the `add_lang` command, which was never shipped,
        but renamed `msg_init`.

0.80  2012-10-01T19:00:55Z
      - Switched from `system()` to IPC::Run3, so that STDOUT and STDERR
        messages can be passed to the Dist::Zilla logger.
      - Added new `dzil` commands:
        + `msg-scan` - Scan modules for messages to create translation template file
        + `msg-init` - Create a new language translation file
        + `msg-merge` - Merge message changes into translation files
      - Added short tutorial as main documentation, Dist::Zilla::LocaleTextDomain.
